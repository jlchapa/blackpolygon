# brain

Mini games to keep your mind sharp and fight brain rot. Each game is a standalone, responsive web app implemented with modern Web Components and no external frameworks.

The project follows a clean and modern UX. Layouts are spacious, typography is clear and both light and dark themes are supported. Each update should respect this look and feel.

A landing page (`index.html`) lets you choose a game or open the settings page where you can toggle the light/dark theme.

## Games

### Sequence
A memory game where a 3Ã—3 grid of cells flashes in a pattern. Each cell plays a unique tone when highlighted. Repeat the pattern to increase your score. The sequence grows by one each round.

To play, open `sequence/index.html` in your browser.

### Digits
A recall game where a string of digits flashes on screen for a moment. Type the digits in the same order to increase your score. The sequence gets longer each round.

To play, open `digits/index.html` in your browser.

### Shapes
A pattern-matching game where five shapes appear at the bottom of the screen.
Watch the sequence that flashes in the centre, then click the shapes in the same
order. Pleasant tones play for each shape to help memorisation.

To play, open `shapes/index.html` in your browser.
