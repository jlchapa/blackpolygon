Creative coding experiments.

The **brain** project in this repository provides small web games designed to 
fight brain rot and improve attention, focus, memory and agility. Every game is
implemented with modern HTML, CSS and JavaScript so they run directly in the
browser.

This repository contains multiple independent projects. Every project sits in its own folder at the repository root and includes a README with details on how to run it. When the structure of a project changes or new projects are added, update this file for future reference.

## Projects

- **TouchDesigner** – Visual experiments created with the TouchDesigner tool.
- **brain** – Web-based mini games aimed at exercising memory and attention.

To try a project, navigate into its folder and follow the instructions in its README. Most web projects can be opened directly in a browser by loading their `index.html` file.
