Creative coding experiments.

This repository contains multiple independent projects. Every project sits in its own folder at the repository root and includes a README with details on how to run it. When the structure of a project changes or new projects are added, update this file for future reference.

## Projects

- **TouchDesigner** – Visual experiments created with the TouchDesigner tool.
- **brain** – Web-based mini games aimed at exercising memory and attention.

To try a project, navigate into its folder and follow the instructions in its README. Most web projects can be opened directly in a browser by loading their `index.html` file.
